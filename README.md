# Setup Script

This is a full setup script for a fresh linux install

> Note this is Fedora only at this stage

Overtime might update to make it compatible with debian based distros

## Desciption

This command will install ansible, and once installed with python dependencies will run a `setup` ansible-playbook.

## Install

Once you logged into your user start a terminal and run the following command

```shell
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kozmixb/setup-script/refs/heads/main/setup.sh |bash
```
